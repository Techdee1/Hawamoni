HAWAMONI - SOLANA STUDENTS AFRICA HACKATHON PROGRESS REPORT

Project: Hawamoni - Campus Treasury Management with Solana Pay Integration
Track: Campus Tools Powered by Solana Pay
Team: Techdee1

OVERVIEW

During this hackathon, we built Hawamoni - a fully functional campus treasury management platform with deep Solana Pay integration. The platform solves critical problems faced by African student organizations: lack of financial transparency, democratic control over group funds, and expensive payment processing.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS

1. SOLANA PAY INTEGRATION
- Complete Solana Pay standard compliance with QR code generation
- Three campus-specific payment types: Split Bills, Group Dues, Payment Requests
- Integration with major wallets (Phantom, Solflare, WalletConnect)
- Mobile-first sharing and instant settlement capabilities

2. DEMOCRATIC TREASURY MANAGEMENT
- Multi-signature approval system requiring 80% member consensus
- Transparent withdrawal request workflow with real-time voting
- Member management with role-based permissions including faculty oversight
- Complete audit trail with exportable financial reports

3. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
- Built on Next.js 14 with TypeScript and Solana Web3.js integration
- PWA capabilities with mobile-responsive design optimized for African devices
- Comprehensive error handling and professional UI with Tailwind CSS
- Real-time SOL/NGN balance conversions and transaction history

CAMPUS APPLICATIONS

Hawamoni directly addresses real problems in African universities:
- Student associations managing collective funds transparently
- Club equipment purchases requiring democratic approval
- Event planning with complex payment collection from multiple students
- Faculty oversight and institutional audit requirements
- Elimination of traditional banking delays and high fees for micro-transactions

DEMO READINESS

The platform is fully functional with complete user flows, realistic mock data representing actual student organizations like "Robotics Society" with 134+ members, and professional UI that builds institutional trust. All core features from wallet connection to payment execution work seamlessly across mobile and desktop.

IMPACT

Hawamoni addresses a significant market need across African universities where student organizations collectively manage millions of naira annually. By leveraging Solana's speed and low fees with transparent on-chain records, we're enabling the next generation of student leaders to build trust and accountability in their financial operations.

The platform transforms how student groups handle collective finances, making democratic governance practical and institutional oversight seamless while eliminating traditional banking barriers common across African campuses.
